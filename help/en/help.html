<b>YP Shopwise Account</b><br>

What is a YP Shopwise account?<br>

With a single confidential and secured subscription, your YP Shopwise account makes it possible for you to select your preferred deal categories, create a deal selection based on your preferences, add and manage your favourites.<br> 

Moreover, your YP Shopwise account lets you connect to the entire Yellow Pages Group properties by using a single email account and password.<br> 

You can create a YP Shopwise account with Facebook Connect or your email address.<br>

You can log out from your account by tapping the « Log out » button at the bottom of the menu accessible through your profile picture. <br><br>



<b>Profile picture</b><br>

By tapping on your profile picture, you will access a menu with your favourites and your preferences.<br> 

If you created your account with Facebook Connect, your profile picture is the one you set on Facebook.<br>

If you created your account with your email address, your profile picture can be set by tapping on the default camera icon.<br><br> 



<b>Account with an email address - Why do I need to confirm my email address?</b><br>

Email confirmation is an important security check that helps prevent other people from signing up for a YP Shopwise account using your email address. Upon signing up for your account, we'll send a short email with confirmation instructions to the email address you gave us. It should only take a few seconds to confirm your email address by clicking the confirmation link in the email we sent you. If you have not confirmed your email address yet, you will be advised when you try to log in.<br><br>



<b>I haven't received my email confirmation. What should I do?</b><br>

The email confirmation is sent to the email address you used to sign up for your YP Shopwise account. (Note: this email address may be different from your Facebook email address).

If you did not receive the email confirmation, it may be due to an invalid email address or restrictions from your email provider or internet service that are blocking email from YP Shopwise.

First, check the email address you provided us with. There may be a typo in the email address. If the email address is correct, then check your email spam filters to make sure that the confirmation email hasn't been sent to your junk, spam or bulk mail folders.

If you find a typo in the email address or you can't find the confirmation email in your spam folders, please create a new YP Shopwise account.<br><br>



<b>What is Facebook Connect?</b><br>

Facebook Connect allows users to share community information very quickly and efficiently based on their Facebook account. To learn more about Facebook Connect: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/help/?page=730">http://www.facebook.com/help/?page=730</a> <br><br>





<b>How does privacy work with Facebook Connect sites?</b><br>

When you connect with a website, it can access information you've added through Facebook to allow you to interact with your friends in new and interesting ways. The Platform Developer Terms of Service restrict how YP Shopwise can access this information, and all sites are contractually obligated to respect the privacy settings you've chosen for your account. These are the same terms that developers who have created the applications you use on Facebook must follow.

This means that if you've blocked a user on Facebook, that user will not be able to see you on a "connected" site. When other users connect with a website, those users will not be able to see information you've added through Facebook that they wouldn't otherwise be able to see simply by browsing Facebook. You can decide what type of information your friends' applications can access from the "Applications and Websites" section on the Privacy Settings page.
